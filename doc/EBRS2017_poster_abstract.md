We need more data about bats from all regions where they occur, and it needs to be collected soon if we want to document the current situation before things start to change more rapidly. One way to do this is to record and store sound in full spectrum or time expanded formats for future analysis when better tools and reference libraries of bat sounds are available.

But there are some problems that must be fixed. Recording units for high quality recordings are expensive, it is time consuming to analyse recorded sound from clusters of detectors, sharing and publishing data is complicated and it is hard to find reference recordings to be used for automatic or semi-automatic analysis.

CloudedBats.org is a project where I am trying to use my skills in software development to address these problems. The software is developed as free and open source software and the project home page can be found here: http://cloudedbats.org/ 

Last year, 2016, I developed software for a less expensive recording unit based on a high quality microphone (Pettersson M500-384) and affordable standard hardware. 
This year I am working on a web server software used to collect near real time data from a cluster of recording units. It will also contain functionality for computer assisted species identification and tools for publishing survey data in the DarwinCore format. The latest test version of the web page can be found here: http://test.cloudedbats.org/
Future work will include cloud storage and computation of huge amounts of data. Great technical possibilities are available and I am looking forward to dig deeper into that area.

Open data facilitates data sharing and is becoming the standard alternative for biological monitoring data. The Creative Commons (https://creativecommons.org/) license alternatives CC0 and CC-BY are recommended by international actors like GBIF (http://www.gbif.org/species/734). 

The poster presents software and hardware for bat recordings and data management.

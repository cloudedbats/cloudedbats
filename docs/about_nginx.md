# About nginx

[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) is a web and proxy server.
There is also an open source variant: [nginx.org](https://nginx.org).

## Alternatives

- **Apache** is a similar tool but a little bit more complicated to setup.

- Another alternative is **Caddy**. Caddy uses an extremely clean language
for configuration and supports HTTPS by default.
More info  here: [About Caddy](docs/about_caddy.md)
and here [Setup Caddy](docs/setup_caddy.md).

# CloudedBats - free software for bat monitoring

**Excuse the mess but I'm rebuilding a bit. 
The goal is to make it easier to find among all the 
different more or less completed sub projects.**

The "what" and "why" descriptions have be moved to a 
more traditional website powered by GitHub Pages:

- https://cloudedbats.github.io/

This page will contain the "how" descriptions on a 
detailed technical level. Markdown files here:
